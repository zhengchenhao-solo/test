## An Interesting Project
In c++ community I saw an interesting project named *Daily exercise*, in which I saw a lot of thoughtful exercise. Just like what the author said at the top of page, **deep thinking makes you wise**, it is really worth thinking and can definitely promote level.

Here I list some of the interesting exercises. Some of them have been written by someone else, and some of them haven't. 
* **Find the nearest point**
> Given the coordinates (x, y) of N points on a two-dimensional plane, find the two nearest points.
* **Find the maximum and minimum numbers in the array**
>One of the problems we often encounter is that we need to maximize or minimize an array. What if we want to extract the Max and the min at the same time?
The common practice is to scan the number once and then compare it with the maximum and the current minimum, so the total number of comparisons is 2N,
Where N is the length of the array.
So is there a way to reduce the number of comparisons?
* **Constructing two string with two array**
>If we can get A string equal to B by swapping the lowercase letters in A exactly K times, we call the similarity between the strings A and B K (K is A non-negative integer).
Given two letter ectopic words A and B, return the minimum value of the similarity K of A and B.
